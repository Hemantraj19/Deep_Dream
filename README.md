# Deep Dream Flask App

This is a simple Flask web application that applies the Deep Dream algorithm to images uploaded by users. The Deep Dream algorithm enhances images by amplifying and modifying patterns within them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

Run the Flask application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the app will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Visit the home page at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
2. Upload an image using the provided form.
3. Enter the number of steps for the Deep Dream algorithm to run.
4. Click the "Predict" button.
5. View the enhanced image generated by the Deep Dream algorithm on the result page.

## Code Structure

- `app.py`: The main Python script containing the Flask application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `static/`: Folder containing CSS files for styling.
- `templates/`: Folder containing HTML templates (`index.html` and `result.html`).

## Deep Dream Algorithm

The application uses the Deep Dream algorithm, implemented with TensorFlow and an InceptionV3 model. The algorithm iteratively enhances an input image by modifying it to maximize the activation of specific layers in the neural network.

**Note:** You can customize the Deep Dream algorithm by selecting different layers of the InceptionV3 model (`mixed3`, `mixed5`, etc.). Feel free to experiment with various layers to achieve different visual effects.

For faster output, consider running the application on a GPU-enabled machine.
